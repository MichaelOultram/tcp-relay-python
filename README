Generic TCP relay.

The network application that allows two processes (located between the firewall or NAT) communicate directly using TCP protocol.

relay - is the application that route network traffic between two processes.
echoserver - a test application that performs echo of any incoming messages.

See the following architecture:

                            ----------------                                 
 -----------------          |              |          --------------- 
 | Tunnel Client |----------|  TCP Relay   |----------| Echo Server | 
 -----------------          |              |          --------------- 
                            ----------------                                

USAGE:

Start relay process

$ ./relayserver port & 

Start echoserver process

$ ./echoserver relayhost relayport

After successful connection to relayhost, the echoserver will print out the tunnel host and port (created by tcp relay)

Test your relay:

$ telnet tunnelhost tunnelport

Type any message and hit enter. You should get back the echo of your message.

MISC:

1. By default tcp relay listens 127.0.0.1, feel free to modify host variable in relay source code.
2. TCP relay routes 4096 byte packets, if your application uses larger buffer size, feel free to adjust this variable in relay source code.
3. If connection is terminated from the tunnel client, the tcp relay will close connection to echoserver.
